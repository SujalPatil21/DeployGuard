# DeployGuard — AI-Driven Deployment Impact & Risk Analysis Platform

## Problem Statement

Modern microservice systems are highly interconnected. A performance issue in one service can propagate across dependent services and cause cascading failures.

Common challenges:

- No real-time visibility into which service is risky
- Hard to estimate deployment blast radius
- Latency anomalies are detected late
- Root cause identification across service chains is slow
- Dependency knowledge is often manual and outdated

Result: Deployments become high-risk decisions instead of data-driven actions.

## Solution

DeployGuard is a deployment risk intelligence platform that:

1. Collects live service latency metrics from Prometheus.
2. Detects latency anomalies automatically.
3. Computes relative risk scores per service.
4. Builds a service dependency graph.
5. Propagates risk across upstream and downstream relationships.
6. Calculates blast radius of a deployment.
7. Stores and analyzes dependencies using a graph database.
8. Generates actionable impact reports.

This enables engineers to answer:

- Which service is currently risky?
- If Service X is deployed, what else can break?
- How far will the impact propagate?

## System Workflow

Spring Boot Services → Prometheus Metrics → Python Analytics Engine → Risk Scoring → Dependency Graph → Neo4j → Impact Report

## Pipeline Steps

1. Metrics Collection (fetch_metrics.py)
2. Latency Snapshot Storage (CSV)
3. Anomaly Detection (detect_latency_anomaly.py)
4. Risk Score Computation
5. Dependency Mapping (dependency_graph.py)
6. Risk Propagation (propagate_risk.py)
7. Impact Explanation (explain_risk.py)
8. Deployment Impact Report (impact_report.py)

## How Risk is Calculated

1. Measure latency increase using Prometheus rate metrics.
2. Compute delta between historical and current values.
3. Normalize into relative risk score.
4. Propagate risk through the dependency graph.
5. Estimate total deployment impact.
